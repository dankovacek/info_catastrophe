# Info Theory in Geosciences Reading Group

## Presentation Preamble

On 4 December 2020, Dr. Gupta brought to the group's attention the discussion paper *The Principles of Tomorrow's University* {cite}`Katz_principles`.  I had just discovered the latest offering from [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) called [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), so the timing was serendipitous

Jupyter notebooks have only been around for a few years, but they are quickly being adopted by researchers in many disciplines as a way to efficiently work with data, collaborate on research, and teach.  Jupyter notebooks allow a high level of interactivity with mathematical models of systems, and the ability to change key parameters and see the outcome in real time (in some cases) shortens the feedback loop for developing intuition about a concept, for example [in the plots below](interactive-app) looking at relationships in water level data.

Interactive application exploring water level at two locations on the same river.  
```

Jupyter Book is basically a way to bring together a bunch of Jupyter notebooks with slick formatting.  Project Jupyter embodies the goals presented by {cite}`Katz_principles`, so the idea is to integrate these goals into today's reading group subject, *The Infomation Catastrophe.* {cite}`Vopson_infocat`

## Publication

As far as **publication** is concerned, I asked IPython creator [Fernando PÃ©rez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez) about participating organizations, [his response is shown below](perez-tweet):
